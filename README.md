# First Neural Network

**1/6/18**
- added precision, recall, and F1 calculations

**1/4/18**
- added ADAM optimization, still need to debug
- figured out how to shuffle matrices; now shuffling:
    - prior to partitioning into train/cv sets
    - prior to partitioning into minibatches

**1/3/18**
- added batch gradient descent, still need to figure out how to shuffle matrices

**1/2/18** 
- added L<sub>2</sub> regularization, still need to cleanup
- fixed roundoff error
- added feature normalization function
- moved away from jupyter notebook

**12/30/18** 
- added ReLU
- recursive forward and back propagation functions
- combined derivative functions for cost function and activation functions
- modularized
- using dictionaries to store majority of data

**12/29/18** 
- not yet functional
